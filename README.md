- Criteria-based Scoring: Checks for length, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- Visual Feedback: Dynamic color changes based on security levels (Weak, Moderate, Strong).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3
- Logic: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- OS Environment: Developed and tested on Kali Linux
